  <h1>Farro Vegetable Hash with Chemoula</h1>
  <img src="../images/farrohash.jpeg" alt="Spicy Kimchi Fritters">
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Think of this as breakfast fried rice but with nutty-chewy farro instead for maximum texture. If you aren’t up for making the chermoula, we won’t judge if you use store-bought green hot sauce instead. This recipe is from chef Ashleigh Shanti at Benne on Eagle in Asheville, NC.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>Chemoula</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tsp. coriander seeds</li>
    <li>1 tsp. cumin seeds</li>
    <li>1 tsp. black peppercorns</li>
    <li>2 cups (lightly packed) cilantro leaves with tender stems</li>
    <li>2 cups (lightly packed) parsley leaves with tender stems</li>
    <li>1 cup (lightly packed) mint leaves</li>
    <li>2 tsp. lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. (or more) fresh lemon juice</li>
    <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Hash</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>¾ cup whole farro</li>
    <li>2 medium sweet potatoes (about 1 lb.), scrubbed, cut into ½" pieces</li>
    <li>4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 bacon slices, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1 medium sweet onion, coarsely chopped</li>
    <li>1Tbsp. thyme leaves</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 cup brussels sprouts, leaves removed, cores thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. toasted benne or sesame seeds, plus more for sprinkling</li>
    <li>4 over-easy or fried eggs</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Special Equipment:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>A spice mill or mortar and pestle</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
    <h4>Chemoula</h4>
    <li>Toast coriander seeds and cumin seeds in a dry small skillet over medium-high heat, tossing occasionally, until fragrant and just beginning to take on color, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a spice mill or mortar and pestle and let cool. Add peppercorns and finely grind; set aside.</li>
    <li>Purée cilantro, parsley, mint, 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and ¼ cup water in a blender, adding more water 1 Tbsp. at a time if needed, until a coarse purée forms. Transfer to a small bowl. Add oil, lemon zest, red pepper flakes, and reserved spice mixture. Season chermoula with salt and more lemon juice if needed.</li>
    <h4>Hash</h4>
    <li>Cook farro in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until al dente, 30–40 minutes. Drain farro well and let cool slightly.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375°. Toss sweet potatoes on a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. oil to coat; season with salt. Roast, tossing halfway through, until lightly browned and tender, 12–15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium. Add bacon and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and mostly crisp, 7–9 minutes. Add onion and thyme and cook, tossing occasionally, until onion is softened, 6–8 minutes. Add garlic and brussels sprouts and cook, tossing occasionally, until garlic is softened and brussels sprouts are bright green and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Add farro, sweet potatoes, and 1 Tbsp. benne seeds. Cook hash, tossing occasionally, until farro is warmed through, about 3 minutes; season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>To serve, divide hash among plates and top with eggs. Spoon chermoula over and sprinkle with benne seeds.</li>
